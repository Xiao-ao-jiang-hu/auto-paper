  "title": "A GNN-Guided Predict-and-Search Framework for Mixed-Integer Linear Programming",
  "abstract": "Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) is widely employed for modeling combinatorial optimization problems. In practice, similar MILP instances with only coefficient variations are routinely solved, and machine learning (ML) algorithms are capable of capturing common patterns across these MILP instances. In this work, we combine ML with optimization and propose a novel predict-and-search framework for efficiently identifying high-quality feasible solutions. Specifically, we first utilize graph neural networks to predict the marginal probability of each variable, and then search for the best feasible solution within a properly defined ball around the predicted solution. We conduct extensive experiments on public datasets, and computational results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves 51.1% and 9.9% performance improvements to MILP solvers SCIP and Gurobi on primal gaps, respectively.",
  "problem_description_natural": "The paper addresses the challenge of efficiently solving repeated instances of mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems that share structural similarities but differ in coefficients. Traditional MILP solvers do not exploit these commonalities across instances. The authors aim to use machine learning—specifically graph neural networks (GNNs)—to predict variable-wise marginal probabilities indicating how likely each binary variable is to be 1 in a high-quality solution. Instead of directly outputting a potentially infeasible solution, their method searches for the best feasible solution within a trust region (a bounded neighborhood) around the predicted point, ensuring feasibility while leveraging learned patterns.",
