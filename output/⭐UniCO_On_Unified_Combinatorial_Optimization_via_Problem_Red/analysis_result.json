  "title": "UNICO: ON UNIFIED COMBINATORIAL OPTIMIZATION VIA PROBLEM REDUCTION TO MATRIX-ENCODED GENERAL TSP",
  "abstract": "Various neural solvers have been devised for combinatorial optimization (CO), which are often tailored for specific problem types, e.g. TSP, CVRP and SAT, etc. Yet, it remains an open question how to achieve universality regarding problem representing and learning with a general framework. This paper first proposes UniCO, to unify a set of CO problems by reducing them into the general TSP form featured by distance matrices. The applicability of this strategy depends on the efficiency of the problem reduction and solution transition procedures, which we show that at least ATSP, HCP, and SAT are readily feasible. The hope is to allow for the effective and even simultaneous use of as many types of CO instances as possible to train a neural TSP solver, and optionally finetune it for specific problem types. In particular, unlike the prevalent TSP benchmarks based on Euclidean instances with 2-D coordinates, our studied domain of TSP could involve non-metric, asymmetric or discrete distances without explicit node coordinates, which is much less explored in TSP literature while poses new intellectual challenges. Along this direction, we devise two neural TSP solvers with and without supervision to conquer such matrix-formulated input, respectively: 1) MatPOENet and 2) MatDIFFNet. The former is a reinforcement learning-based sequential model with pseudo one-hot embedding (POE) scheme; and the latter is a Diffusion-based generative model with the mix-noised reference mapping scheme. Experiments on ATSP, 2DTSP, HCP- and SAT-distributed general TSPs show the strong ability towards arbitrary matrix-encoded TSP with structure and size variation.",
  "problem_description_natural": "The paper addresses the challenge of developing a universal neural framework for solving diverse combinatorial optimization (CO) problems by reducing them to a generalized form of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Unlike traditional TSP formulations that rely on Euclidean coordinates, this generalized TSP is defined purely by arbitrary cost (distance) matrices that may be asymmetric, non-metric, or discrete. The approach leverages polynomial-time reductions from problems like Asymmetric TSP (ATSP), Hamiltonian Cycle Problem (HCP), and Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) into this matrix-encoded general TSP. A trained neural solver for general TSP can then be used to solve all reducible CO problems by transforming their instances into TSP cost matrices, solving them, and mapping the TSP tour back to the original problem’s solution.",
