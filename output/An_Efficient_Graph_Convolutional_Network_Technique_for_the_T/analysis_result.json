  "title": "An Efficient Graph Convolutional Network Technique for the Travelling Salesman Problem",
  "abstract": "This paper introduces a new learning-based approach for approximately solving the Travelling Salesman Problem on 2D Euclidean graphs. We use deep Graph Convolutional Networks to build efficient TSP graph representations and output tours in a non-autoregressive manner via highly parallelized beam search. Our approach outperforms all recently proposed autoregressive deep learning techniques in terms of solution quality, inference speed and sample efficiency for problem instances of fixed graph sizes. In particular, we reduce the average optimality gap from 0.52% to 0.01% for 50 nodes, and from 2.26% to 1.39% for 100 nodes. Finally, despite improving upon other learning-based approaches for TSP, our approach falls short of standard Operations Research solvers.",
  "problem_description_natural": "The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) asks for the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city, given a list of cities and the distances between each pair. Formally, given a graph with nodes representing cities in a 2D Euclidean space, the goal is to find a permutation (tour) of the nodes that minimizes the total tour length, defined as the sum of Euclidean distances between consecutive cities in the tour, including the return edge from the last city back to the first.",

  "algorithm_description": "A non-autoregressive deep learning approach using Graph Convolutional Networks (graph ConvNet) to predict edge probabilities in the TSP tour from input node coordinates. The probabilities are converted to a valid tour using beam search decoding. The model is trained in a supervised manner with cross-entropy loss on optimal TSP solutions generated by the Concorde solver."
