  "title": "DeepACO: Neural-enhanced Ant Systems for Combinatorial Optimization",
  "abstract": "Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a meta-heuristic algorithm that has been successfully applied to various Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs). Traditionally, customizing ACO for a specific problem requires the expert design of knowledge-driven heuristics. In this paper, we propose DeepACO, a generic framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to automate heuristic designs. DeepACO serves to strengthen the heuristic measures of existing ACO algorithms and dispense with laborious manual design in future ACO applications. As a neural-enhanced meta-heuristic, DeepACO consistently outperforms its ACO counterparts on eight COPs using a single neural model and a single set of hyperparameters. As a Neural Combinatorial Optimization method, DeepACO performs better than or on par with problem-specific methods on canonical routing problems.",
  "problem_description_natural": "The paper addresses the challenge of manually designing effective heuristic measures for Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) when applied to Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs). Traditional ACO relies on problem-specific heuristics crafted by experts, which is time-consuming, inflexible, and difficult for less-studied problems. DeepACO automates this process by using a graph neural network trained via deep reinforcement learning to generate heuristic measures from problem instances. These learned heuristics guide both solution construction and an enhanced local search procedure, improving performance across a wide range of COPs—including routing, assignment, scheduling, and subset selection—without requiring manual tuning per problem.",
