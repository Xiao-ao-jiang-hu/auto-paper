  "title": "Learning Local Search Heuristics for Boolean Satisfiability",
  "abstract": "We present an approach to learn SAT solver heuristics from scratch through deep reinforcement learning with a curriculum. In particular, we incorporate a graph neural network in a stochastic local search algorithm to act as the variable selection heuristic. We consider Boolean satisfiability problems from different classes and learn specialized heuristics for each class. Although we do not aim to compete with the state-of-the-art SAT solvers in run time, we demonstrate that the learned heuristics allow us to find satisfying assignments in fewer steps compared to a generic heuristic, and we provide analysis of our results through experiments.",
  "problem_description_natural": "The paper addresses the Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem, which involves determining whether there exists a truth assignment to Boolean variables that satisfies a given propositional formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF). The authors focus on improving stochastic local search (SLS) algorithms by replacing handcrafted variable selection heuristics with ones learned via deep reinforcement learning. Specifically, they train a graph neural network (GNN) to guide the selection of which variable to flip at each step of the local search, aiming to reduce the number of steps needed to find a satisfying assignment. The approach is evaluated on multiple SAT problem classes, including random 3-SAT and encodings of NP-complete graph problems such as clique detection, vertex cover, graph coloring, and dominating set.",

  "algorithm_description": "The paper uses a graph neural network (GNN) based policy network trained with reinforcement learning (REINFORCE algorithm) to learn variable selection heuristics for stochastic local search (SLS) on Boolean satisfiability problems. The GNN takes the CNF formula and current assignment as input and outputs a probability distribution over variables to flip, which is used within a local search framework to find satisfying assignments."
