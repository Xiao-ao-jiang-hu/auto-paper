  "title": "Collaboration! Towards Robust Neural Methods for Routing Problems",
  "abstract": "Despite enjoying desirable efficiency and reduced reliance on domain expertise, existing neural methods for vehicle routing problems (VRPs) suffer from severe robustness issues – their performance significantly deteriorates on clean instances with crafted perturbations. To enhance robustness, we propose an ensemble-based Collaborative Neural Framework (CNF) w.r.t. the defense of neural VRP methods, which is crucial yet underexplored in the literature. Given a neural VRP method, we adversarially train multiple models in a collaborative manner to synergistically promote robustness against attacks, while boosting standard generalization on clean instances. A neural router is designed to adeptly distribute training instances among models, enhancing overall load balancing and collaborative efficacy. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness and versatility of CNF in defending against various attacks across different neural VRP methods. Notably, our approach also achieves impressive out-of-distribution generalization on benchmark instances.",
  "problem_description_natural": "The paper addresses the vulnerability of neural methods for vehicle routing problems (VRPs) to adversarial perturbations—small, crafted modifications to input instances that cause significant performance degradation. The goal is to improve both standard generalization (performance on clean, unperturbed instances) and adversarial robustness (performance on perturbed instances) without sacrificing one for the other. The authors focus on classic VRP variants including the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), Asymmetric TSP (ATSP), and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), where the objective is to find optimal or near-optimal tours that minimize total travel cost while satisfying problem-specific constraints (e.g., visiting each node exactly once in TSP, or respecting vehicle capacity in CVRP).",
