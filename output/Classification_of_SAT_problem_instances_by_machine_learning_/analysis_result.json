  "title": "Classification of SAT Problem Instances by Machine Learning Methods",
  "abstract": "Efficient SAT solving is critical in many practical applications. State-of-the-art SAT solvers can solve SAT problems with more than 100,000 variables and millions of clauses. They have usually more than 10 options, and we might combine them. We need those options to get better runtime. Our experience shows that we can get significant speed up if we use the suitable options. Our goal is to create a neural network based system, which can select the best option configuration for the input SAT instance. As a first step, we created a system that can predict the type of a SAT problem. Our system has two main tools: CNFStats and the prediction tool. The CNFStats can compute several properties of the input SAT instance. For example, how many variables, clauses, unit, binary clause are in the input. How many horn clauses, so called black and white clauses are in the input. These properties generated by CNFStats are the input for the prediction tool. The prediction tool is a multi-layer perceptron neural network, which is able to do classification over SAT problem instances found on the SATLIB webpage, see: https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hoos/SATLIB/benchm.html. The neural network is written in .NET from scratch. It is easy to configure by using a webpage. The user can give the number of layers, number of neurons, and the activation function, train it, test it and save it. In the prediction tool we use those 48 properties which is computed by the CNFStats tool. We used the half of the input problems from SATLIB to train the neural network. Classes were the same as in the webpage. The most successful neural network was using 2 hidden layers, 125 neurons in each hidden layer, the activation function was the sigmoid function (other activation functions did not perform well in these settings), 10,000 training runs with 0.033 learning rate. The accuracy was 95%. The second best neural network was the same but with 1 hidden layer and 250 neurons.",
  "problem_description_natural": "The paper addresses the problem of automatically classifying SAT (Boolean satisfiability) problem instances into known categories (e.g., Random3SAT, Pigeonhole, Dubois, etc.) based on structural features extracted from their CNF (conjunctive normal form) representation. The motivation is that modern SAT solvers have many configurable options, and selecting the right configuration can significantly improve runtime performance. Instead of directly tuning solver parameters, the authors propose first identifying the problem type using machine learning, which can then inform optimal solver configuration. To enable this, they extract 48 hand-crafted features from each SAT instance (such as clause counts, variable-to-clause ratios, Horn clause statistics, and expert-designed heuristic flags like 'mayBePigeonHole') and use these as input to classifiers. The core optimization challenge is thus meta-level: improving SAT solving efficiency by accurately predicting problem class to guide algorithm configuration.",

  "algorithm_description": "The paper uses machine learning methods to classify SAT problem instances. Features are extracted from CNF formulas using the CNFStats tool, which computes 48 properties such as number of variables, clauses, and clause types. These features are used to train classifiers including a multilayer perceptron neural network (with configurable layers, neurons, and activation functions), support vector machines, naive Bayes, decision trees (J48), and random forests. The models are trained and evaluated on corpora from SATLIB (SAT33 and SAT19) using 10-fold cross-validation, with random forest achieving the highest accuracy (up to 99.03%)."
