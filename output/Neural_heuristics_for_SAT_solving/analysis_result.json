  "title": "NEURAL HEURISTICS FOR SAT SOLVING",
  "abstract": "We use neural graph networks with a message-passing architecture and an attention mechanism to enhance the branching heuristic in two SAT-solving algorithms. We report improvements of learned neural heuristics compared with two standard human-designed heuristics.",
  "problem_description_natural": "The paper addresses the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT), which involves determining whether there exists a satisfying assignment for a given propositional logic formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF). The authors focus on improving the branching heuristic—specifically the 'choose-literal' step—in complete backtracking-based SAT solvers like DPLL and CDCL. Instead of using traditional hand-crafted heuristics such as DLIS or JW-OS, they propose replacing this step with a learned policy from a neural network that predicts, for each literal, whether assigning it true leads to a satisfying solution. The goal is to reduce the number of branching decisions (i.e., search steps) required to solve SAT instances, particularly on larger problems with over 100 variables.",
