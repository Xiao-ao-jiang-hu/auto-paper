  "title": "UDC: A Unified Neural Divide-and-Conquer Framework for Large-Scale Combinatorial Optimization Problems",
  "abstract": "Single-stage neural combinatorial optimization solvers have achieved near-optimal results on various small-scale combinatorial optimization (CO) problems without requiring expert knowledge. However, these solvers exhibit significant performance degradation when applied to large-scale CO problems. Recently, two-stage neural methods motivated by divide-and-conquer strategies have shown efficiency in addressing large-scale CO problems. Nevertheless, the performance of these methods highly relies on problem-specific heuristics in either the dividing or the conquering procedure, which limits their applicability to general CO problems. Moreover, these methods employ separate training schemes and ignore the interdependencies between the dividing and conquering strategies, often leading to sub-optimal solutions. To tackle these drawbacks, this article develops a unified neural divide-and-conquer framework (i.e., UDC) for solving general large-scale CO problems. UDC offers a Divide-Conquer-Reunion (DCR) training method to eliminate the negative impact of a sub-optimal dividing policy. Employing a high-efficiency Graph Neural Network (GNN) for global instance dividing and a fixed-length sub-path solver for conquering divided sub-problems, the proposed UDC framework demonstrates extensive applicability, achieving superior performance in 10 representative large-scale CO problems.",
  "problem_description_natural": "The paper addresses the challenge of solving large-scale combinatorial optimization (CO) problems using neural methods. Traditional single-stage neural solvers perform well on small instances (e.g., TSP with ≤200 nodes) but degrade significantly on larger instances. Existing neural divide-and-conquer approaches partition a large problem into sub-problems and solve them separately, but they often depend on problem-specific heuristics and use separate training for dividing and conquering stages, leading to sub-optimal and non-generalizable solutions. The proposed UDC framework overcomes these limitations by introducing a unified training scheme (Divide-Conquer-Reunion) that jointly optimizes both stages using learning-based policies—employing a lightweight GNN for dividing and constructive neural solvers for conquering—without relying on handcrafted heuristics. It is evaluated on 10 diverse large-scale CO problems, showing improved performance and broad applicability.",

  "algorithm_description": "The UDC framework is a neural divide-and-conquer method that solves large-scale combinatorial optimization problems by first dividing the instance into sub-problems using a heatmap-based Graph Neural Network (GNN), then conquering each sub-problem with constructive neural solvers (e.g., attention-based models), and finally merging sub-solutions. It employs a unified training scheme called Divide-Conquer-Reunion (DCR) using reinforcement learning to jointly optimize the dividing and conquering policies, eliminating the negative impact of sub-optimal dividing results."
