  "title": "SimGNN: A Neural Network Approach to Fast Graph Similarity Computation",
  "abstract": "Graph similarity search is among the most important graph-based applications, e.g. finding the chemical compounds that are most similar to a query compound. Graph similarity/distance computation, such as Graph Edit Distance (GED) and Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS), is the core operation of graph similarity search and many other applications, but very costly to compute in practice. Inspired by the recent success of neural network approaches to several graph applications, such as node or graph classification, we propose a novel neural network based approach to address this classic yet challenging graph problem, aiming to alleviate the computational burden while preserving a good performance.",
  "problem_description_natural": "The paper addresses the problem of efficiently computing graph similarity metrics—specifically Graph Edit Distance (GED)—which is known to be NP-complete and computationally expensive for even moderately sized graphs. The goal is to learn a fast, differentiable function using neural networks that can predict graph similarity scores with high accuracy while significantly reducing computation time compared to exact or heuristic combinatorial methods. The model must be representation-invariant (independent of node ordering), inductive (generalize to unseen graphs), and adaptable to different similarity metrics through training.",
