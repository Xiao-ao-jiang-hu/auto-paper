  "title": "Multi-Decoder Attention Model with Embedding Glimpse for Solving Vehicle Routing Problems",
  "abstract": "We present a novel deep reinforcement learning method to learn construction heuristics for vehicle routing problems. In specific, we propose a Multi-Decoder Attention Model (MDAM) to train multiple diverse policies, which effectively increases the chance of finding good solutions compared with existing methods that train only one policy. A customized beam search strategy is designed to fully exploit the diversity of MDAM. In addition, we propose an Embedding Glimpse layer in MDAM based on the recursive nature of construction, which can improve the quality of each policy by providing more informative embeddings. Extensive experiments on six different routing problems show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning based models.",
  "problem_description_natural": "The paper addresses vehicle routing problems (VRPs), such as the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), which are combinatorial optimization problems involving finding optimal routes for vehicles to visit a set of locations under certain constraints (e.g., capacity limits). The goal is to construct high-quality feasible solutions efficiently using learned heuristics rather than hand-crafted rules or exact solvers. The proposed method improves both solution diversity and quality by training multiple decoding policies and dynamically refining node embeddings during the construction process to exclude already visited nodes.",
