  "abstract": "The formal semantics of an interpreted first-order logic (FOL) statement can be given in Tarskian Semantics or a basically equivalent Game Semantics. The latter maps the statement and the interpretation into a two-player semantic game. Many combinatorial problems can be described using interpreted FOL statements and can be mapped into a semantic game. Therefore, learning to play a semantic game perfectly leads to the solution of a specific instance of a combinatorial problem. We adapt the AlphaZero algorithm so that it becomes better at learning to play semantic games that have different characteristics than Go and Chess. We propose a general framework, Persephone, to map the FOL description of a combinatorial problem to a semantic game so that it can be solved through a neural MCTS based reinforcement learning algorithm. Our goal for Persephone is to make it tabula-rasa, mapping a problem stated in interpreted FOL to a solution without human intervention.",
  "problem_description_natural": "The paper addresses the problem of solving combinatorial problems that can be expressed in interpreted first-order logic (FOL). Instead of directly solving the logical formula, the authors transform the problem into a two-player semantic game using game-theoretic semantics, where one player (the Proponent) tries to prove the formula true and the other (the Opponent) tries to refute it. The goal is to learn optimal strategies for these players using a neural Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) based reinforcement learning algorithm. The framework, called Persephone, automatically maps an FOL-expressible combinatorial problem into such a game and solves it without human-designed heuristics, aiming for a tabula rasa approach.",
