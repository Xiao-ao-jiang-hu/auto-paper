  "title": "Efficient Combinatorial Optimization via Heat Diffusion",
  "abstract": "Combinatorial optimization problems are widespread but inherently challenging due to their discrete nature. The primary limitation of existing methods is that they can only access a small fraction of the solution space at each iteration, resulting in limited efficiency for searching the global optimal. To overcome this challenge, diverging from conventional efforts of expanding the solver’s search scope, we focus on enabling information to actively propagate to the solver through heat diffusion. By transforming the target function while preserving its optima, heat diffusion facilitates information flow from distant regions to the solver, providing more efficient navigation. Utilizing heat diffusion, we propose a framework for solving general combinatorial optimization problems. The proposed methodology demonstrates superior performance across a range of the most challenging and widely encountered combinatorial optimizations. Echoing recent advancements in harnessing thermodynamics for generative artificial intelligence, our study further reveals its significant potential in advancing combinatorial optimization.",
  "problem_description_natural": "The paper addresses general combinatorial optimization problems, particularly pseudo-Boolean optimization (PBO), where the goal is to minimize a real-valued target function over binary variables (e.g., s ∈ {−1,1}^n). The approach reformulates the discrete problem into a continuous, differentiable one by parameterizing binary variables as Bernoulli distributions with parameters θ ∈ [0,1]^n, then uses heat diffusion to transform the objective function in a way that preserves global optima while enabling gradient-based optimization with enhanced global information propagation. The method is designed to handle problems ranging from quadratic to polynomial, binary to ternary, unconstrained to constrained, and discrete to mixed-variable settings.",

  "algorithm_description": "Heat Diffusion Optimization (HeO) is a gradient-based framework that uses heat diffusion to transform the objective function $f(\\mathbf{s})$ into smoothed versions $u(\\tau, \\boldsymbol{\\theta})$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ is a continuous relaxation of $\\mathbf{s}$. By solving the heat equation and performing gradient descent on $u(\\tau, \\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ with projection onto the feasible domain, HeO propagates information from distant regions of the solution space to efficiently guide the solver towards the global optimum. The method handles various combinatorial optimization problems, including those with constraints, by incorporating penalty functions or other techniques."
