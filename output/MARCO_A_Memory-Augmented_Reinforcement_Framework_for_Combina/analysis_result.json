  "title": "MARCO: A Memory-Augmented Reinforcement Framework for Combinatorial Optimization",
  "abstract": "Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) is an emerging domain where deep learning techniques are employed to address combinatorial optimization problems as a standalone solver. Despite their potential, existing NCO methods often suffer from inefficient search space exploration, frequently leading to local optima entrapment or redundant exploration of previously visited states. This paper introduces a versatile framework, referred to as Memory-Augmented Reinforcement for Combinatorial Optimization (MARCO), that can be used to enhance both constructive and improvement methods in NCO through an innovative memory module. MARCO stores data collected throughout the optimization trajectory and retrieves contextually relevant information at each state. This way, the search is guided by two competing criteria: making the best decision in terms of the quality of the solution and avoiding revisiting already explored solutions. This approach promotes a more efficient use of the available optimization budget. Moreover, thanks to the parallel nature of NCO models, several search threads can run simultaneously, all sharing the same memory module, enabling an efficient collaborative exploration. Empirical evaluations, carried out on the maximum cut, maximum independent set and travelling salesman problems, reveal that the memory module effectively increases the exploration, enabling the model to discover diverse, higher-quality solutions. MARCO achieves good performance in a low computational cost, establishing a promising new direction in the field of NCO.",
  "problem_description_natural": "The paper addresses general combinatorial optimization problems, with specific empirical evaluations on three graph-based problems: the Maximum Cut (MC) problem, which seeks to partition a graph’s nodes into two subsets such that the number (or weight) of edges between the subsets is maximized; the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem, which aims to find the largest subset of nodes such that no two nodes in the subset are adjacent; and the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), which involves finding the shortest possible route that visits each node exactly once and returns to the origin node. The proposed MARCO framework enhances neural solvers—both constructive (e.g., for TSP) and improvement-based (e.g., for MC and MIS)—by incorporating a memory module that records and retrieves previously visited solutions to guide future decisions, balancing solution quality and exploration diversity.",

  "algorithm_description": "MARCO (Memory-Augmented Reinforcement for Combinatorial Optimization) is a framework that integrates a memory module into neural combinatorial optimization methods. For the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), it uses a neural constructive method to build solutions incrementally via reinforcement learning, with the memory storing past solutions to retrieve contextually relevant information, promoting exploration and avoiding redundant states. The framework supports parallel threads with shared memory for collaborative search."
