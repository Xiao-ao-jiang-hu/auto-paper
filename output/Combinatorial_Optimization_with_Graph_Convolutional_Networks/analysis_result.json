  "abstract": "We present a learning-based approach to computing solutions for certain NP-hard problems. Our approach combines deep learning techniques with useful algorithmic elements from classic heuristics. The central component is a graph convolutional network that is trained to estimate the likelihood, for each vertex in a graph, of whether this vertex is part of the optimal solution. The network is designed and trained to synthesize a diverse set of solutions, which enables rapid exploration of the solution space via tree search. The presented approach is evaluated on four canonical NP-hard problems and five datasets, which include benchmark satisfiability problems and real social network graphs with up to a hundred thousand nodes. Experimental results demonstrate that the presented approach substantially outperforms recent deep learning work, and performs on par with highly optimized state-of-the-art heuristic solvers for some NP-hard problems. Experiments indicate that our approach generalizes across datasets, and scales to graphs that are orders of magnitude larger than those used during training.",
  "problem_description_natural": "The paper addresses four canonical NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems: Satisfiability (SAT), Maximal Independent Set (MIS), Minimum Vertex Cover (MVC), and Maximal Clique (MC). All these problems are formulated on graphs, and the goal is to find an optimal subset of vertices satisfying specific constraints—e.g., for MIS, the largest set of vertices with no edges between them; for MVC, the smallest set of vertices touching all edges; for MC, the largest fully connected subset; and for SAT, a satisfying assignment to Boolean variables in a conjunctive normal form formula. The authors convert all problems into equivalent MIS instances and use a graph convolutional network to guide a tree search that explores diverse candidate solutions, followed by local search refinement.",

  "algorithm_description": "The method uses a graph convolutional network (GCN) trained with a diversity-promoting loss to predict multiple probability maps over vertices, indicating the likelihood of each vertex belonging to an optimal solution. These maps guide a parallelized tree search that explores many candidate solutions, which are then refined by classic graph reduction and local search heuristics."
