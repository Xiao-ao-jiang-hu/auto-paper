  "title": "HubRouter: Learning Global Routing via Hub Generation and Pin-hub Connection",
  "abstract": "Global Routing (GR) is a core yet time-consuming task in VLSI systems. Recent machine learning approaches, especially generative models, suffer from non-connectivity in the generated routes, requiring extensive post-processing. To address this, the authors propose HubRouter, a novel two-phase learning scheme that redefines GR as a hub-pin connection problem. The first phase uses deep generative models in a multi-task framework to generate 'hubs'—key routing points—along with stripe masks to suppress noise. The second phase connects pins and hubs using an actor-critic model to construct a Rectilinear Steiner Minimum Tree (RSMT). Experiments show HubRouter outperforms state-of-the-art generative GR methods in wirelength, overflow, and runtime while guaranteeing connectivity. It also demonstrates generalizability to RSMT construction and interactive path replanning.",
  "problem_description_natural": "The paper addresses the global routing (GR) problem in VLSI physical design, which involves connecting multiple pins (terminals) of each net on a chip layout using routing paths through a grid of global routing cells (GCells). The goal is to minimize total wirelength while avoiding congestion (i.e., exceeding edge capacity limits), all while ensuring that all pins in a net are connected by a single continuous route. Traditional and recent learning-based methods either scale poorly or fail to guarantee connectivity in one-shot generative outputs, necessitating costly post-processing. HubRouter reframes this as a two-stage problem: first generating intermediate 'hub' points that capture essential topological features of valid routes, then efficiently connecting these hubs and pins into a fully connected tree structure.",
