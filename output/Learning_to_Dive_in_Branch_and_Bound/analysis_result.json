  "abstract": "Primal heuristics are important for solving mixed integer linear programs, because they find feasible solutions that facilitate branch and bound search. A prominent group of primal heuristics are diving heuristics. They iteratively modify and resolve linear programs to conduct a depth-first search from any node in the search tree. Existing divers rely on generic decision rules that fail to exploit structural commonality between similar problem instances that often arise in practice. Therefore, we propose L2Dive to learn specific diving heuristics with graph neural networks: We train generative models to predict variable assignments and leverage the duality of linear programs to make diving decisions based on the model’s predictions. L2Dive is fully integrated into the open-source solver SCIP. We find that L2Dive outperforms standard divers to find better feasible solutions on a range of combinatorial optimization problems. For real-world applications from server load balancing and neural network verification, L2Dive improves the primal-dual integral by up to 7% (35%) on average over a tuned (default) solver baseline and reduces average solving time by 20% (29%).",
  "problem_description_natural": "The paper addresses the challenge of efficiently solving mixed integer linear programs (MILPs), which involve optimizing a linear objective function subject to linear constraints, where some variables must take integer values. These problems appear in real-world applications such as server load balancing and neural network verification. Standard solvers use branch-and-bound algorithms, which benefit from primal heuristics—especially diving heuristics—that quickly find feasible integer solutions by performing depth-first searches in the solution space using LP relaxations. However, traditional diving heuristics use generic rules that do not adapt to recurring structural patterns across similar problem instances. The authors propose L2Dive, a method that learns instance-specific diving strategies using graph neural networks trained on feasible solutions from past instances, and uses LP duality to guide variable selection and bound tightening during diving.",

It trains a generative graph neural network on good feasible solutions from training instances to predict assignments for integer variables. At test time, it uses the model's predictions and dual reasoning (leveraging LP duality) to select variables and tighten bounds in a depth-first diving search, integrated into the SCIP solver."
