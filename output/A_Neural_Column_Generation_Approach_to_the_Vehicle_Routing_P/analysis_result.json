  "title": "A Neural Column Generation Approach to the Vehicle Routing Problem with Two-Dimensional Loading and Last-In-First-Out Constraints",
  "abstract": "The vehicle routing problem with two-dimensional loading constraints (2L-CVRP) and the last-in-first-out (LIFO) rule presents significant practical and algorithmic challenges. While numerous heuristic approaches have been proposed to address its complexity, stemming from two NP-hard problems: the vehicle routing problem (VRP) and the two-dimensional bin packing problem (2D-BPP), less attention has been paid to developing exact algorithms. Bridging this gap, this article presents an exact algorithm that integrates advanced machine learning techniques, specifically a novel combination of attention and recurrence mechanisms. This integration accelerates the state-of-the-art exact algorithm by a median of 29.79% across various problem instances. Moreover, the proposed algorithm successfully resolves an open instance in the standard test-bed, demonstrating significant improvements brought about by the incorporation of machine learning models.",
  "problem_description_natural": "The problem involves planning delivery routes for a fleet of homogeneous vehicles to serve a set of customers, where each customer requires delivery of multiple rectangular items. Each vehicle has a fixed two-dimensional loading area (length and width) and a weight capacity. The items must be packed without overlap or rotation into the vehicle’s loading area, and the LIFO (last-in-first-out) unloading constraint must be respected—meaning that items for later customers cannot block access to items for earlier customers during unloading. The goal is to minimize total travel cost while ensuring all customers are visited exactly once and all loading and capacity constraints are satisfied.",

  "algorithm_description": "The paper proposes a Neural Column Generation (NCG) algorithm that integrates a machine learning model into a column generation framework to solve the 2L-CVRP with LIFO constraints. The ML model, combining attention and recurrence mechanisms, predicts the feasibility of candidate routes with respect to 2D packing and LIFO constraints, accelerating the pricing problem by reducing calls to an exact feasibility checker. The overall method is an exact algorithm (branch-and-price-and-cut) that uses the ML model as a heuristic filter within the column generation iterations."
