  "abstract": "Scalable addressing of high dimensional constrained combinatorial optimization problems is a challenge that arises in several science and engineering disciplines. Recent work introduced novel application of graph neural networks for solving quadratic-cost combinatorial optimization problems. However, effective utilization of models such as graph neural networks to address general problems with higher order constraints is an unsolved challenge. This paper presents a framework, HypOp, which advances the state of the art for solving combinatorial optimization problems in several aspects: (i) it generalizes the prior results to higher order constrained problems with arbitrary cost functions by leveraging hypergraph neural networks; (ii) enables scalability to larger problems by introducing a new distributed and parallel training architecture; (iii) demonstrates generalizability across different problem formulations by transferring knowledge within the same hypergraph; (iv) substantially boosts the solution accuracy compared with the prior art by suggesting a fine-tuning step using simulated annealing; (v) shows a remarkable progress on numerous benchmark examples, including hypergraph MaxCut, satisfiability, and resource allocation problems, with notable run time improvements using a combination of fine-tuning and distributed training techniques. We showcase the application of HypOp in scientific discovery by solving a hypergraph MaxCut problem on NDC drug-substance hypergraph. Through extensive experimentation on various optimization problems, HypOp demonstrates superiority over existing unsupervised learning-based solvers and generic optimization methods.",
  "problem_description_natural": "The paper addresses a general class of constrained combinatorial optimization problems with discrete integer variables, arbitrary (potentially non-convex and non-linear) cost functions, and higher-order constraints that involve subsets of variables beyond pairwise interactions. The variables take values from a finite ordered set, and the constraints are defined over subsets of these variables. To make the problem amenable to gradient-based learning, the authors relax the discrete variables into continuous ones within a bounded interval, solve the relaxed problem using a hypergraph neural network (HyperGNN) as a learnable transformation function in an unsupervised manner, and then map the continuous outputs back to discrete assignments—enhanced via simulated annealing. The constraints and variable interactions are modeled using a hypergraph, where each hyperedge corresponds to a constraint involving multiple variables.",
