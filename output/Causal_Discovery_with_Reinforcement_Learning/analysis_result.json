  "title": "Causal Discovery with Reinforcement Learning",
  "abstract": "Discovering causal structure among a set of variables is a fundamental problem in many empirical sciences. Traditional score-based causal discovery methods rely on various local heuristics to search for a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) according to a predefined score function. While these methods, e.g., greedy equivalence search, may have attractive results with infinite samples and certain model assumptions, they are less satisfactory in practice due to finite data and possible violation of assumptions. Motivated by recent advances in neural combinatorial optimization, we propose to use Reinforcement Learning (RL) to search for the DAG with the best scoring. Our encoder-decoder model takes observable data as input and generates graph adjacency matrices that are used to compute rewards. The reward incorporates both the predefined score function and two penalty terms for enforcing acyclicity. In contrast with typical RL applications where the goal is to learn a policy, we use RL as a search strategy and our final output would be the graph, among all graphs generated during training, that achieves the best reward. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, and show that the proposed approach not only has an improved search ability but also allows a flexible score function under the acyclicity constraint.",
  "problem_description_natural": "The paper addresses the problem of finding the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that best explains observed data according to a predefined score function (e.g., BIC). This involves optimizing over the space of all possible DAGs, which is combinatorially large and constrained by acyclicity. The authors formulate this as a search problem where the objective is to minimize a score function subject to the graph being acyclic. Instead of using traditional local search heuristics, they employ Reinforcement Learning with an encoder-decoder neural network to generate candidate graphs and use a reward signal—combining the negative score, a hard penalty for cyclic graphs, and a soft differentiable acyclicity penalty based on the matrix exponential—to guide the search toward high-scoring DAGs.",

  "algorithm_description": "The paper uses reinforcement learning (actor-critic algorithm) to search for the DAG with the best score. The actor is an encoder-decoder neural network that generates graph adjacency matrices from observed data. The reward function incorporates the score function and two penalty terms for acyclicity. The training objective is to maximize the expected reward, and policy gradient methods are used. The final output is the graph (among all generated during training) that achieves the best reward."
