  "title": "Sample Complexity Bounds for Score-Matching: Causal Discovery and Generative Modeling",
  "abstract": "This paper provides statistical sample complexity bounds for score-matching and its applications in causal discovery. The authors demonstrate that accurate estimation of the score function is achievable by training a standard deep ReLU neural network using stochastic gradient descent. They establish bounds on the error rate of recovering causal relationships using the score-matching-based causal discovery method of Rolland et al. [2022], assuming a sufficiently good estimation of the score function. Additionally, they analyze the upper bound of score-matching estimation within score-based generative modeling, which is also of independent interest in generative models.",
  "problem_description_natural": "The paper addresses the problem of estimating the score function (the gradient of the log probability density) from finite observational data using deep ReLU neural networks trained via stochastic gradient descent. This estimation is used in two contexts: (1) causal discovery under non-linear additive Gaussian noise models, where the goal is to recover the topological ordering of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing causal relationships; and (2) score-based generative modeling (e.g., ScoreSDE), where accurate score estimation enables sampling from complex data distributions via reverse stochastic differential equations. The core optimization problem is minimizing the expected squared error between the true score function and a neural network approximation—either through explicit score matching (ESM) or denoising score matching (DSM). The work focuses on deriving finite-sample statistical guarantees (sample complexity bounds) for this estimation and analyzing how estimation errors propagate to downstream tasks like causal structure recovery.",
