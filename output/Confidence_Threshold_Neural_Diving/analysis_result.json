  "abstract": "Finding a better feasible solution in a shorter time is an integral part of solving Mixed Integer Programs. We present a post-hoc method based on Neural Diving [1] to build heuristics more flexibly. We hypothesize that variables with higher confidence scores are more definite to be included in the optimal solution. For our hypothesis, we provide empirical evidence that confidence threshold technique produces partial solutions leading to final solutions with better primal objective values. Our method won 2nd place in the primal task on the NeurIPS 2021 ML4CO competition. Also, our method shows the best score among other learning-based methods in the competition.",
  "problem_description_natural": "The paper addresses the primal task in Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), where the goal is to find high-quality feasible solutions quickly to minimize the primal integral—a measure of how fast good primal bounds are found over time. Given MILP instances of the form min c^T x subject to A^T x ≤ b and x ∈ ℤ^p × ℝ^{n−p}, the method generates partial variable assignments using a trained graph neural network and fixes only those variables for which the model’s prediction confidence exceeds a chosen threshold. The resulting partial solution is then completed by a MIP solver (SCIP). The approach aims to accelerate the discovery of better primal solutions compared to standard solver heuristics.",

It uses confidence scores from the model to fix variables with high confidence, then employs a solver (e.g., SCIP) to complete the solution, aiming to minimize the primal integral within a time limit."
