  "title": "Combining Reinforcement Learning with Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun Algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem",
  "abstract": "We address the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), a famous NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. And we propose a variable strategy reinforced approach, denoted as VSR-LKH, which combines three reinforcement learning methods (Q-learning, Sarsa and Monte Carlo) with the well-known TSP algorithm, called Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun (LKH). VSR-LKH replaces the inflexible traversal operation in LKH, and lets the program learn to make choice at each search step by reinforcement learning. Experimental results on 111 TSP benchmarks from the TSPLIB with up to 85,900 cities demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed method.",
  "problem_description_natural": "The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) involves finding the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city, given a set of cities and the distances between them. It is a classic NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with applications in logistics, manufacturing, and other domains requiring efficient routing or sequencing.",

It replaces the inflexible traversal operation in LKH's k-opt process with a learned policy to select edges, using a defined Q-value (combining distance and α-value) and a variable strategy mechanism to switch between RL methods for improved flexibility and robustness."
