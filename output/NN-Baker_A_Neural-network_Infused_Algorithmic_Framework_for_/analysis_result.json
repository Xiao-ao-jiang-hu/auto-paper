  "title": "NN-Baker: A Neural-network Infused Algorithmic Framework for Optimization Problems on Geometric Intersection Graphs",
  "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed a surge of approaches to use neural networks to help tackle combinatorial optimization problems, including graph optimization problems. However, theoretical understanding of such approaches remains limited. In this paper, we consider the geometric setting, where graphs are induced by points in a fixed dimensional Euclidean space. It turns out that several graph optimization problems can be approximated (in a bicriteria manner) by an algorithm that runs in time linear in graph size $n$ via a framework that we call the Baker-paradigm. A key advantage of the Baker-paradigm is that it decomposes the input problem into (at most linear number of) small sub-problems of **bounded sizes** (independent of the size of the input). For the family of such bounded-size sub-problems, we can now design neural networks with universal approximation guarantees to solve them. This leads to a mixed algorithmic-ML framework, which we call NN-Baker that has the capacity to approximately solve a family of graph optimization problems (e.g. maximum independent set and minimum vertex cover) in time linear in the input graph size. We instantiate our NN-Baker by a CNN version and GNN version, and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach via a range of experiments.",
  "problem_description_natural": "The paper addresses combinatorial optimization problems—specifically, the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) and Minimum Vertex Cover—on geometric intersection graphs. These graphs are constructed from points in a fixed-dimensional Euclidean space (e.g., centers of unit balls in ℝ^d), where edges represent intersections between geometric objects (e.g., two unit balls intersect if their centers are within distance 2). The goal is to find near-optimal solutions efficiently for large-scale instances. The authors propose a bi-criteria approximation: instead of requiring strict independence (non-intersecting unit balls), they allow a relaxed condition where selected points are separated by a slightly larger margin (controlled by parameter ε), while still guaranteeing a solution size close to optimal. Their method leverages a decomposition technique (Baker-paradigm) to break the problem into small, bounded-size subproblems that can be solved exactly or approximately using neural networks with theoretical guarantees.",

  "algorithm_description": "The paper proposes NN-Baker, a neural-network infused algorithmic framework based on the Baker-paradigm. It decomposes the geometric graph into small, bounded-size subproblems via a randomly shifted grid. A neural network (CNN or GNN) is trained to solve these subproblems approximately, replacing an exact but expensive brute-force step. The solutions from all cells are then combined to form a global solution. The framework provides a bi-criteria approximation with theoretical guarantees and linear-time complexity in the graph size."
