  "abstract": "Deriving from image matching and understanding, semantic keypoint matching aims at establishing correspondence between keypoint sets in images. As graphs are powerful tools to represent points and their complex relationships, graph matching provides an effective way to find desired semantic keypoint correspondences. Recent deep graph matching methods have shown excellent performance, but there is still a lack of exploration and utilization of spatial information of keypoints as nodes in graphs. More specifically, existing methods are insufficient to capture the relative spatial relations through current graph construction approaches from the locations of semantic keypoints. To address these issues, we introduce a positional reconstruction encoder-decoder (PR-EnDec) to model intrinsic graph spatial structure, and present an end-to-end graph matching network PREGM based on PR-EnDec. Our PR-EnDec consists of a positional encoder that learns effective node spatial embedding with the affine transformation invariance, and a spatial relation decoder that further utilizes the high-order spatial information by reconstructing the locational structure of graphs contained in the node coordinates. Extensive experimental results on four public keypoint matching datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PREGM.",
  "problem_description_natural": "The paper addresses the problem of semantic keypoint matching between two images by formulating it as a graph matching task. Each image is represented as an undirected graph where nodes correspond to semantic keypoints and edges encode spatial relationships. The goal is to find a binary correspondence matrix X that indicates which nodes (keypoints) in one graph match those in the other, under the constraint that each node matches exactly one node in the other graph (i.e., X is a permutation matrix). This is cast as a quadratic assignment problem (QAP), which maximizes a quadratic objective x^T K x, where x is the vectorized correspondence matrix and K is an affinity matrix encoding node and edge similarities. The core challenge is that existing deep graph matching methods underutilize the rich spatial (positional) information inherent in keypoint coordinates. The authors propose enhancing node representations with a Positional Reconstruction Encoder-Decoder (PR-EnDec) that learns affine-invariant positional embeddings and reconstructs high-order spatial relations (e.g., relative distances and areas) to improve matching accuracy.",
