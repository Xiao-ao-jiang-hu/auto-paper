  "abstract": "Recently, deep learning based methods have demonstrated promising results on the graph matching problem, by relying on the descriptive capability of deep features extracted on graph nodes. However, one main limitation with existing deep graph matching (DGM) methods lies in their ignorance of explicit constraint of graph structures, which may lead the model to be trapped into local minimum in training. In this paper, we propose to explicitly formulate pairwise graph structures as a quadratic constraint incorporated into the DGM framework. The quadratic constraint minimizes the pairwise structural discrepancy between graphs, which can reduce the ambiguities brought by only using the extracted CNN features. Moreover, we present a differentiable implementation to the quadratic constrained-optimization such that it is compatible with the unconstrained deep learning optimizer. To give more precise and proper supervision, a well-designed false matching loss against class imbalance is proposed, which can better penalize the false negatives and false positives with less overfitting. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance on real-world datasets.",
  "problem_description_natural": "The paper addresses the graph matching problem, which seeks an optimal one-to-one node correspondence between two graphs. Traditional formulations cast this as a quadratic assignment problem (QAP), specifically the Koopmans-Beckmann form, which minimizes the Frobenius norm of the difference between adjacency matrices after alignment, while also maximizing node affinity. The authors extend this by incorporating deep features and explicitly enforcing a quadratic constraint that minimizes the structural (adjacency) discrepancy between graphs using feature-weighted adjacency matrices. The optimization involves minimizing ||A_D - X B_D X^T||_F^2 - tr(K_p^T X), where A_D and B_D are deep-feature-weighted adjacency matrices, K_p is the learned node affinity matrix, and X is the correspondence matrix constrained to be doubly stochastic during training (relaxed) and a permutation matrix during inference. A differentiable Frank-Wolfe-based algorithm is used to solve this non-convex quadratic constrained optimization in a way compatible with gradient-based deep learning training.",

  "algorithm_description": "The paper proposes a deep graph matching method that incorporates quadratic constraint into a differentiable framework. It uses CNN (VGG16) to extract deep features from images, aligns them to graph nodes, and adds geometric prior (coordinates). Node attributes are refined via Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) or SplineCNN, and node affinity matrix $\\mathbf{K}_p^l$ is constructed. Weighted adjacency matrices $\\mathbf{A}_D$ and $\\mathbf{B}_D$ are built using deep features. A relaxed quadratic assignment problem (QAP) is formulated with objective minimizing structural discrepancy and maximizing node affinity, subject to continuous constraints. During training, a differentiable Frank-Wolfe algorithm with Sinkhorn normalization is used to solve the optimization, and a false matching loss is applied for supervision. During inference, Hungarian algorithm is used for discrete matching."
