  "title": "Online 3D Bin Packing with Constrained Deep Reinforcement Learning",
  "abstract": "We solve a challenging yet practically useful variant of 3D Bin Packing Problem (3D-BPP). In our problem, the agent has limited information about the items to be packed into a single bin, and an item must be packed immediately after its arrival without buffering or readjusting. The item’s placement also subjects to the constraints of order dependence and physical stability. We formulate this online 3D-BPP as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). To solve the problem, we propose an effective and easy-to-implement constrained deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method under the actor-critic framework. In particular, we introduce a prediction-and-projection scheme: The agent first predicts a feasibility mask for the placement actions as an auxiliary task and then uses the mask to modulate the action probabilities output by the actor during training. Such supervision and projection facilitate the agent to learn feasible policies very efficiently. Our method can be easily extended to handle lookahead items, multi-bin packing, and item re-orienting. We have conducted extensive evaluation showing that the learned policy significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. A preliminary user study even suggests that our method might attain a human-level performance.",
  "problem_description_natural": "The paper addresses an online version of the 3D Bin Packing Problem (3D-BPP), where items arrive sequentially and must be packed immediately into a single bin without knowledge of future items (except possibly a small lookahead window). Each item is a cuboid defined by integer length, width, and height, and must be placed such that it fits within the bin dimensions and satisfies physical stability constraints (e.g., sufficient support under its bottom surface). The placement decision is irrevocable—no repacking or adjustments are allowed after an item is placed. The goal is to maximize the number (or total volume) of items packed into the bin, which corresponds to maximizing space utilization under strict operational constraints typical in logistics and warehousing automation.",
