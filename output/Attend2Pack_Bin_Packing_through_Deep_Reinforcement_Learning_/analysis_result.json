  "title": "Attend2Pack: Bin Packing through Deep Reinforcement Learning with Attention",
  "abstract": "This paper seeks to tackle the bin packing problem (BPP) through a learning perspective. Building on self-attention-based encoding and deep reinforcement learning algorithms, we propose a new end-to-end learning model for this task of interest. By decomposing the combinatorial action space, as well as utilizing a new training technique denoted as prioritized oversampling, which is a general scheme to speed up on-policy learning, we achieve state-of-the-art performance in a range of experimental settings. Moreover, although the proposed approach attend2pack targets offline-BPP, we strip our method down to the strict online-BPP setting where it is also able to achieve state-of-the-art performance. With a set of ablation studies as well as comparisons against a range of previous works, we hope to offer as a valid baseline approach to this field of study.",
  "problem_description_natural": "The bin packing problem (BPP) involves packing a set of items (boxes) into one or more bins (containers) such that the number of bins used is minimized or, in the single-bin variant studied here, the volume utilization of the bin is maximized. The paper focuses on the 3D single container loading problem (SCLP), a form of offline BPP where all item dimensions are known in advance. The goal is to pack all N boxes into a single bin of fixed width and height but variable effective length, maximizing the utility defined as the ratio of total item volume to the volume of the minimal bounding container that encloses the packed items. Constraints include no overlap between items and physical feasibility (e.g., each box must be supported from below and placed in contact with other boxes or container walls). Boxes can be rotated in 6 possible orientations, and placement decisions must respect geometric constraints.",
