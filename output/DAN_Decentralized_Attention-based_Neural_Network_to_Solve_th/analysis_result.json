  "title": "DAN: Decentralized Attention-based Neural Network for the MinMax Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem",
  "abstract": "The multiple traveling salesman problem (mTSP) is a well-known NP-hard problem with numerous real-world applications. In particular, this work addresses MinMax mTSP, where the objective is to minimize the max tour length among all agents. Many robotic deployments require recomputing potentially large mTSP instances frequently, making the natural trade-off between computing time and solution quality of great importance. However, exact and heuristic algorithms become inefficient as the number of cities increases, due to their computational complexity. Encouraged by the recent developments in deep reinforcement learning (dRL), this work approaches the mTSP as a cooperative task and introduces DAN, a decentralized attention-based neural method that aims at tackling this key trade-off. In DAN, agents learn fully decentralized policies to collaboratively construct a tour, by predicting each other’s future decisions. Our model relies on the Transformer architecture and is trained using multi-agent RL with parameter sharing, providing natural scalability to the numbers of agents and cities. Our experimental results on small- to large-scale mTSP instances (50 to 1000 cities and 5 to 20 agents) show that DAN is able to match or outperform state-of-the-art solvers while keeping planning times low. In particular, given the same computation time budget, DAN outperforms all conventional and dRL-based baselines on larger-scale instances (more than 100 cities, more than 5 agents), and exhibits enhanced agent collaboration.",
  "problem_description_natural": "The MinMax Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (MinMax mTSP) involves coordinating multiple agents (salesmen) starting from a common depot to visit a set of cities exactly once and return to the depot, with the goal of minimizing the longest tour length (i.e., the makespan) among all agents. The problem is defined on a complete Euclidean graph where edge weights correspond to distances between cities. Each city must be visited by exactly one agent, and all agents begin and end at the depot. The challenge lies in jointly partitioning the cities among agents and sequencing each agent's tour to minimize the maximum individual tour cost.",
