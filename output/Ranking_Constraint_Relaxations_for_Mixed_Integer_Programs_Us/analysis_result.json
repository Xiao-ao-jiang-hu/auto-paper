  "abstract": "Solving large-scale Mixed Integer Programs (MIP) can be difficult without advanced algorithms such as decomposition based techniques. Even if a decomposition technique might be appropriate, there are still many possible decompositions for any large MIP and it may not be obvious which will be the most effective. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the predictive capabilities of a Machine Learning ranking (ML) function for predicting the quality of Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) decompositions created via constraint relaxation. In this analysis, the role of instance similarity and ML prediction quality is explored, as well as the benchmarking of a ML ranking function against existing heuristic functions. For this analysis, a new dataset consisting of over 40000 unique decompositions sampled from across 24 instances from the MIPLIB2017 library has been established. These decompositions have been created by both a greedy relaxation algorithm as well as a population based multi-objective algorithm, which has previously been shown to produce high quality decompositions. In this paper, we demonstrate that a ML ranking function is able to provide state-of-the-art predictions when benchmarked against existing heuristic ranking functions. Additionally, we demonstrate that by only considering a small set of features related to the relaxed constraints in each decomposition, a ML ranking function is still able to be competitive with heuristic techniques. Such a finding is promising for future constraint relaxation approaches, as these features can be used to guide decomposition creation. Finally, we highlight where a ML ranking function would be beneficial in a decomposition creation framework.",
  "problem_description_natural": "The paper addresses the challenge of automatically selecting high-quality decompositions for large-scale Mixed Integer Programs (MIPs) using constraint relaxation. Decomposition methods like Lagrangian Relaxation, Benders Decomposition, and Dantzig-Wolfe Reformulation require identifying 'complicating' constraints to relax, thereby breaking the problem into smaller, independent subproblems. However, for general MIPs without known structure, it is unclear which constraints to relax or how to evaluate the resulting decomposition's effectiveness. The authors propose using Machine Learning to rank candidate decompositions based on features derived from the relaxed constraints, with decomposition quality measured by a combination of solution time and bound quality obtained via Lagrangian Relaxation. They generate over 40,000 decompositions from 24 MIPLIB2017 instances using both greedy and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, then train and evaluate ML models to predict decomposition performance, comparing them against existing heuristic metrics like Relative Border Area and Goodness Score.",
